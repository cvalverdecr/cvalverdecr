### Hi there 👋

Mi name is Carlos Valverde, I'm an apassionate from computer science from San José, Costa Rica 🇨🇷

With some years of expirience in Microsoft technologies and now using new technologies, willing to learn new stuff everyday and help people get into technology.

🌱 I’m currently learning React Native, DotNet Core, Xamarin, Android.

⚡  Fun fact: I like cyclism (Road & MTB), also the Crossfit
